    // order for plugins with the same priority is determined by their order on the plugin page
    // plugins are loaded top-to-bottom
    // so if you want to force your css to be the last thing included (to override everything else)
    // you should set the priority to 1000 and move this plugin to the very bottom of the list

	// Extend system CSS with our own styles
	// this function is extending the view called "css/elgg" with our own custom view
	// called "customize_css/css"
	// this means that Elgg's css can remain unchanged, and our css will be included afterward
	// so any changes we want to make will overwrite the default styles

	// our customize_css/css view will be found in our plugin at

	// it is in this file you can safely make changes

// in this case it will execute the function customize_css_init()
// and it will do so during the initialization of the system
