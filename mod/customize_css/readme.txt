 This plugin does nothing by itself.  It is simply meant as a starter plugin
 for those unfamiliar with Elgg that need to make small adjustments to the css.
 
 It provides the correct method of extending the css view, changing the core files
 is highly discouraged and completely unnecessary.
 
 
 Instructions
 
 Open start.php and read the inline comments, these will explain the basic operation of HOW the
 plugin overrides the default css.  Set the priority if necessary.
 
 Open views/default/customize_css/css.php and add in your custom css rules.
 
 Copies of the core css files are available for your reference
 in views/default/customize_css/reference/
